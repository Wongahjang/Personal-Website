			<h3>Favourite Foods</h3>
			<p>My favourite food is ayam gepuk. I’ve tried many types of ayam gepuk in Malaysia such as Pak Gembus, Top Global and the one at UiTM Puncak Alam. But for me, the best one is Ayam Gepuk AG in Kelantan</p>

			<h3>Favourite Drinks</h3>
			<p>My favourite drink is matcha hehe. I’m a matcha lover and even though it tastes like grass, it’s the only drink I really like. One of the reasons is because when I drink it, it helps me stay awake</p>

		<div class="fav-card">
			<img src="movie_favourite.jpg" alt="Movie">
			<h3>Favourite Movies</h3>
			<p>Out of all the movies I’ve watched, this is the one I like the most. The horror and thriller genre in this movie feels very intense, more than anything I’ve seen before. I’m not usually someone who watches movies but this one made me more interested in horror films</p>
		</div>

		<div class="fav-card">
			<img src="music_favourite.jpg" alt="Music">
			<h3>Favourite Music</h3>
			<p>For me, my favorite songs are the ones on Spotify. I prefer listening to music rather than watching shows or movies. I listen to music while working, driving and jogging. Songs are like the rhythm of my life which means, what I do depends on the tempo. For example, when I go jogging, I listen to songs with a tempo that helps me keep my pace</p>

		<div class="fav-card">
			<img src="hobby_favourite.jpg" alt="Hobby">
			<h3>Favourite Hobbies</h3>
			<p>My favorite hobby is bowling. I used to represent my school in tenpin bowling competitions and even represented the state of Selangor. I ranked in the top 20 out of over 200 players at that time. I enjoy bowling because every throw helps me release all my stress similar to playing badminton</p>

		<div class="fav-card">
			<img src="game_favourite.jpg" alt="Game">
			<h3>Favourite Games</h3>
			<p>This is my favorite game out of all the games I’ve played. It is a standalone auto-battler strategy game based on the "Magic Chess" mode from Mobile Legends: Bang Bang (MLBB). The game has MLBB heroes, lets you build teams strategically and has a special system with "Go Go Cards" and commander skills that let players make their own strategies in an 8-player battle</p>

		<div class="fav-card">
			<img src="books_favourite.jpg" alt="Books">
			<h3>Favourite Novels</h3>
			<p>The only novels I read are the ones by Fixie. Most of Fixie’s books are fiction and include genres like horror, mystic and thriller which I really love to read. I am easily scared but I enjoy these genres because they are very interesting</p>
		</div>

		<div class="fav-card">
			<img src="place_favourite.jpg" alt="Places">
			<h3>Favourite Places</h3>
			<p>My favorite places are all the places I go with someone special. I don't have a specific place that I like because I rarely go out but they are the one who always takes me to places I've never been before</p>
		</div>

		<div class="fav-card">
			<img src="quotes_favourite.jpg" alt="Quote">
			<h3>Favourite Quotes</h3>
			<p>My quote that I hold onto to this day is "It's not over until I win". When I read this quote, it makes me want to challenge myself until I succeed. I will never give up, no matter what the situation is</p>
