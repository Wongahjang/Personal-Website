            <h3>Picupicu Friends</h3>
            <p>Picupicu friends are like my own family. Even though we rarely meet, we always support each other. We love to joke around, play games together and share interesting stories. We also often plan trips so we can meet up</p>

            <h3>Lepak Bila Free (LBF)</h3>
            <p>Just like our group name, we hang out whenever we are free because they are my close friends from secondary school. Now, all of us are studying in different universities like UNIKL, UiTM, UIA and others. During holidays, for example mid-semester break or Christmas break, we will plan to meet and hang out together</p>

            <h3>Trio Aneh</h3>
            <p>They're my friends from primary school. Actually, I had many more friends back then but since most of us didn’t have phones or contact numbers, we lost touch with many of them. Out of all the friends I had in primary school, these two are the ones who always stayed around and still keep in contact with each other</p>

            <h3>Komanderzz</h3>
            <p>Since I joined UiTM, I have joined a uniformed unit called Komander. There are many members and I don’t know everyone, especially the girls. However, in Komander, I still have many close male friends who always help me. Some of them are also my roommates and clubmates</p>

            <h3>Bowling TR Team</h3>
            <p>I met the three of them while representing bowling in the college games (CGames). They are all really good at bowling and share the same interest as me. I plan to play bowling with them again</p>
        </div>

            <h3>Perkuruan</h3>
            <p>I'm the president of the department crew and I included them because this department is the most supportive in the cultural club. They are very approachable and easy to work with. They're also very creative in making props, handling technical lighting and doing makeup. I will take good care of my team</p>
