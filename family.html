			<h4>Me</h4>
			<p>My name is Mohammad Izwan Hakimi bin Mohammad Faizol and I'm 20 years old. I'm a student at UiTM Kelantan Campus, currently in the 5th semester of the Diploma in Information Management. I'm the oldest child in my family and have three siblings. Like my parents, I enjoy playing bowling and badminton as hobbies when I am at home</p>

			<h4>Brother</h4>
			<p>His name is Mohammad Izwan Hafizi bin Mohammad Faizol and he's 18 years old. He studies at MITS Sabak Bernam and is taking his SPM exam this year (2025). He has memorized all 30 juz of the Quran and lives in a hostel. When he comes home, the house becomes lively because of his presence. He's also good at playing badminton and bowling</p>

			<h4>Sister</h4>
			<p>Her name is Nor Aufa Hannani binti Mohammad Faizol and she's 11 years old. She studies at SKPA2, the school where my father teaches and recently she took the UPKK exam. She's one of my younger sisters and the most spoiled and stubborn in the family. Even so, she likes to explore new things on her own</p>
		</div>

		<div class="card">
			<div class="img-frame">
				<img src="cat1_family.jpg" alt="Father">
			</div>
			<h4>Bingo</h4>
			<p>Her name is Bingo and she's the oldest female cat in our family. We adopted her in 2015 and now she has been with us for more than 10 years. Among all our cats, she's the most active. She likes to cause trouble and run around the house. Her favorite hobbies are just eating and sleeping</p>
		</div>

		<div class="card">
			<div class="img-frame">
				<img src="cat2_family.jpg" alt="Father">
			</div>
			<h4>Yaya</h4>
			<p>His name is Yaya and he's the only male child of Bingo who is still alive. I don’t remember the exact year he was born but he has been in our family for over 7 years. Unlike Bingo, he is very passive and very picky with food. He doesn’t like fresh fish, only fried chicken. He's also strange when it comes to eating because he likes to eat things that other cats don’t like fried noodles</p>
		</div>

		<div class="card">
			<div class="img-frame">
				<img src="cat3_family.jpg" alt="Father">
			</div>
			<h4>Gebu</h4>
			<p>Her name is Gebu and she's a cat that we don’t know where she came from. At first, she came to our house and we just fed her because she looked hungry at that time. Since then, she keeps coming to our house and now our whole family treats her like an adopted child. She is the most affectionate female cat with our family. When it comes to food, she eats everything we give her</p>
